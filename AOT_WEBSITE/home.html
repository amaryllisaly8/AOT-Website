        <p>100 years ago, titans suddenly appeared on Earth. 
            Soon, human civilization veered on collapse due to the titans. 
            Humans then built a giant wall to defend themselves.
            Within the giant walls, humans lived in peace, but, 
            100 years later, the giant wall is broken.</p>

<h2>Human Form - Eren Yeager</h2>
<p>Eren is the main protagonist of the Attack on Titan live-action films. Unlike his anime/manga counterpart who is passionate and impulsive, 
  the film’s Eren is portrayed as a frustrated and rebellious youth, angry at the oppression within the walled society and obsessed with freedom beyond the walls.</p>
  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p>Lives inside Wall Maria and dreams of seeing the outside world. He’s dissatisfied with society’s fearful compliance and longs for something greater.</p>
  <h3>Inciting Moment:</h3>
  <p>When the Colossal Titan breaches Wall Maria, Eren watches his town fall to chaos and many people—including his friends and possibly family—die. This sparks his drive to fight.</p>
  <h3>Military Life:</h3>
  <p>Two years later, he joins a recon mission to reclaim lost territory and seal the wall. He’s idealistic but not yet a skilled fighter.</p>

<h2>Titan Transformation</h2>
<p>During a battle with Titans, Eren sacrifices himself to save a comrade and is eaten alive by a Titan. 
  However, moments later, a new, powerful Titan appears and fights other Titans viciously—this is Eren’s Titan form.</p>
  <h3> Eren's Titan (Live-Action Version):</h3>
  <p>
    Muscular, savage, and feral in appearance.<br>
    Covered in smoky, charred flesh, with glowing red cracks—more monstrous than the anime version.<br>
    Shows limited control at first but later regains consciousness inside the Titan body.<br>
    His transformation is triggered by stress and near-death, not self-inflicted injury like in the anime.<br>
    Origin Explanation (Film): It’s revealed that Titans were artificial bioweapons created by the government. Eren’s father was involved in these experiments, which led to Eren inheriting the Titan power.

        <h2>ATTACK ON TITAN: PART 1</h2>
        <p>
        Over a hundred years ago, humanity was nearly wiped out by giant humanoid creatures known as Titans, who eat humans. 
        The survivors built massive concentric walls (Wall Maria, Wall Rose, Wall Sheena) to protect themselves.
        The story begins inside the outermost wall. Eren, a rebellious young man, dreams of exploring the outside world. 
        His childhood friends, Mikasa and Armin, also struggle with the restrictive, fearful society within the walls. 
        One day, a massive Colossal Titan appears out of nowhere and destroys a section of Wall Maria, letting in regular Titans who begin devouring people. 
        In the chaos, Mikasa disappears and is presumed dead. Eren vows revenge and joins the military.
        Two years later, Eren is part of a military unit assigned to a mission to seal the broken wall and reclaim lost land. 
        He’s reunited with Mikasa—now a cold, elite soldier loyal to Captain Shikishima (an original character not from the anime/manga). 
        Shikishima is a mysterious and powerful soldier who challenges Eren’s ideals.
        During a Titan battle, Eren is eaten alive. But unexpectedly, a new Titan appears and fights the others—it's Eren, who transforms into a Titan himself.

        <h2>ATTACK ON TITAN: PART 2</h2>
        <p>
        Eren is captured by the military, now seen as a threat. Shikishima reveals that the government is hiding secrets, 
        including the fact that Titans were artificially created as weapons to control the population. 
        Shikishima wants to overthrow the government using Eren’s power, but Eren is unsure if violence is the answer.
        More secrets are revealed: Mikasa is conflicted, torn between loyalty to Shikishima and her feelings for Eren. 
        It’s revealed that Eren’s father was involved in Titan research, and Eren’s powers were inherited from his father's experiments.
        In the final battle, Shikishima transforms into a Titan as well, and a brutal Titan vs. Titan fight ensues. 
        With the help of Mikasa, Armin, and others, Eren defeats him. Eventually, they succeed in sealing the wall, giving humanity new hope.
