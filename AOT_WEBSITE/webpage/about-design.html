          <h2>SETTINGS</h2>
          <p>The Attack on Titan live-action films are set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future where humanity is nearly wiped out by monstrous humanoid beings known as Titans. 
            To survive, humans retreat behind three massive concentric walls—Maria, Rose, and Sheena—which have protected them for a century. 
            Unlike the anime's medieval, European-inspired setting, the live-action version uses a ruined industrial world filled with crumbling cities, abandoned factories, and degraded technology. 
            Society within the walls is tightly controlled by a fearful government that suppresses knowledge and free will. 
            In this version, Titans are not supernatural creatures but artificially created bioweapons designed by the government. 
            The setting is grim, oppressive, and grounded in realism, with strong themes of rebellion, secrecy, and survival in a broken world. 
            This reimagined backdrop creates a darker, more grounded atmosphere, differing significantly from the original manga and anime.

          <h2>THEMES</h2>
          <p>The Attack on Titan live-action films explore deep and gritty themes centered around fear, control, and survival. 
            At its core, the story questions whether true freedom is worth risking one’s life, as humanity hides behind walls built not just of stone, but of fear and lies. 
            The oppressive government maintains power by controlling information and using Titans—biological weapons of its own creation—to manipulate the people. 
            This raises ethical questions about science, power, and morality. The films also reflect how extreme conditions bring out both the best and worst in human nature—some characters act with courage and sacrifice, while others betray or give in to fear. 
            Through characters like Eren, who rebels against confinement, and Mikasa, who struggles with grief and loyalty, the story highlights themes of rebellion, identity, and the cost of survival in a collapsing world.
